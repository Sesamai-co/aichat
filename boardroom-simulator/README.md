**A Real-time Executive Presence Coach powered by GPT-4.**

Technical leaders often struggle to communicate with the C-Suite. This app uses the browser's SpeechRecognition API to capture audio, and an LLM (Language Model) backend to analyze the transcript for "hedging language," brevity, and strategic alignment.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML5, Vanilla JS (No frameworks, for performance).
- **AI Integration:** OpenAI API (GPT-4o-mini) / Anthropic (Claude 3.5).
- **Security:** Client-side processing; "Bring Your Own Key" architecture ensures no API keys are exposed in the client code.


### 💡 Why I built this
To solve the "Bottom Line Up Front" (BLUF) problem in management communication.
